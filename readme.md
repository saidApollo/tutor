## What is Tutor LMS 2.0 Beta?
Tutor LMS 2.0 beta version is built to experience Tutor LMS 2.0 before it is officially released. As this is a beta version, please don’t expect everything to work properly.


## Installing Tutor LMS Beta version
We strongly recommend that you do not install beta releases on live sites.

Use them in a test environment so you can try out the new features, see what breaks without worrying about the consequences, and give us feedback. It is paramount that you follow these guidelines when installing the version, because as the name suggests it is in the stage of development and is not entirely stable, yet.

We will be taking valuable feedback from the version users to get firsthand insight on key improvements.

Follow along the next few steps to find out how you can get about installing the version for testing.
